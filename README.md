This is a project in development for the Museum of Science Fiction in Washington, D.C., 
created in collaboration with Greg Viggiano and Sanjit Singh.

Landscapes of Dying Worlds is a collection of images by Michal Klimczak that emphasizes the ability 
to create and imagine new realities. To add an additional layer to this concept, 
we developed an AR experience for a selected group of the images using Unity.
